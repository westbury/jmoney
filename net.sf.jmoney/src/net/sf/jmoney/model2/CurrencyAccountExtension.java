/**
 * This is a helper class that makes it a little easier for a plug-in to extend
 * the CurrencyAccount object.
 * <P>
 * To add fields and methods to a CurrencyAccount object, one should derive a
 * class from CurrencyAccountExtension. This mechanism allows multiple
 * extensions to a CurrencyAccount object to be added and maintained at runtime.
 * <P>
 * All extensions to CurrencyAccount objects implement the same methods that are
 * in the CurrencyAccount object. This is for convenience so the consumer can
 * get a single object that supports both the original CurrencyAccount methods
 * and the extension methods. All CurrencyAccount methods are passed on to the
 * CurrencyAccount object.
