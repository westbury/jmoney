/**
 * Class that displays a list of entries in a table. The table contains one row
 * control for each entry in the list.
 * <P>
 * Note that it is possible that one transaction may contain two or more entries
 * in the same account. For example, a user may write a check for a deposit and
 * a check for the balance of a purchase. The user may enter this as a single
 * 'split' transaction containing the two checks and a single entry containing
 * the total purchase amount in an expense category. In this situation, the
 * single transaction will have two top-level rows (one for each check).
 * Expanding one of the rows with show two child entries: the other check and
 * the purchase entry.
 * <P>
 * A simple transaction is a transaction that contains two entries where one
 * entry is in a capital account and the other entry is in an income and expense
 * account. This is a common form of transaction and therefore we make a special
 * effort to display such transactions on a single row.
 * <P>
 * Some of the entry properties apply only to entries in capital accounts, some
 * apply only to entries in income and expense accounts, and some apply to
 * entries in both types of accounts. In a simple transaction, all the
 * properties from both entries have a column. Properties from the transaction
 * are displayed in the top level and also have a column. So, we have a column
 * for all the following:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Every property in the transaction</LI>
 * <LI>Every property in an entry that may be applicable given the account
 * being listed, with the exception that if all the entries are in the same
 * account (true in most uses of this class) then no column exists for the
 * account property (as such a column would contain the same account in every
 * row and therefore not be of much use)</LI>
 * <LI>Every property in an entry that may be applicable when the entry is in
 * an income and expense account</LI>
 * </UL>
 * 
 * Some properties may be applicable for both entries in the capital account and
 * for entries in income and expense accounts. There will be two columns for
 * such properties. When an entry is being show on its own child row, we have
 * the choice of which of the two columns we use for the property. We chose to
 * show it in the column that would, for a simple transaction, be used to show
 * the property of the entry in the income and expense account. This makes the
 * child rows look more similar and also ensures that a transfer account is
 * shown.
 * <P>
 * Each column is managed by an IEntriesTableProperty object. Each row is
 * managed by an EntryData object. These two classes
 * must work together to determine the contents of a cell.
 * <P>
 * The credit, debit, and balance columns are special cases and special
 * implementations of IEntriesTableProperty handle those three columns. The
 * other columns fall into one of the above three categories. The rest of this
 * explanation applies only to the latter class of columns.
 * <P>
 * A request for cell contents (whether for displaying text or for creating a
 * cell editor) goes first to the IEntriesTableProperty object. That object then
 * gets data from the EntryData object to create and load the control for
 * the cell. As the IEntriesTableProperty object has the property accessor,
 * the property value associated with the cell can be got and set.
