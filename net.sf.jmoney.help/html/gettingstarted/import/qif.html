<h1>MS Money and Quicken</h1>
<p>MS Money and Quicken are closed source and the file formats are
not published. The only way of getting the data out of MS Money and
Quicken into JMoney is to export to a Quicken Import File (QIF). A
Quicken Import File holds the entries from a single account only. This
mean every account must be exported to a separate file. MS Money and
Quicken only allow this to be done manually, one file at a time!</p>
<p>If you have a lot of accounts and want to get started quickly,
you may export only a few accounts. You may go back and export more
accounts later.</p>
<h2>Importing QIF files into JMoney</h2>
<p>Before you can import data into JMoney, you must first create an
accounting session. To do this, select from the menu <b>File &gt;
New</b>.</p>
<p>Now select from the menu <b>Import &gt; QIF format</b>. The open
dialog supports multiple file selection so you may select the set of QIF
files and they will all be imported in one go. If you prefer to import
them in multiple goes, that is fine too. Transactions that have entries
in more than one account will be correctly merged even if the accounts
are imported at different times.</p>
