<h1>GnuCash</h1>

<p>You can load your GnuCash data into JMoney simply by opening the
GnuCash file from the <b>File &gt; Open</b> menu.</p>

Problems:
<ul>
	<li>There is no 'Open...' in the File menu: You do not have the
	net.sf.jmoney.serializeddatastore plug-in installed.</li>
	<li>The open dialog box does not list 'GnuCash files (*.*)' as a
	file type: You do not have the net.sf.jmoney.gnucash plug-in installed.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Saving the data</h2>

<p>When it comes to saving your data, you have two choices. You may
save it a GnuCash file, or you may save the data in the JMoney format.
If you save your data in GnuCash format then JMoney will automatically
load the accounting data from your GnuCash file when it is started and
will save it back when you exit JMoney or select Save from the File
menu.</p>

<p>The advantage of saving the data in GnuCash format is that you
may switch back and forth between using GnuCash and using JMoney. (Just
don't have both applications running with the same file open at the same
time).</p>

<p>The advantag of saving the data in JMoney format is that the
JMoney format can store accounting data stored in properties that were
added by plug-ins. The GnuCash format, on the other hand, can store only
the properties supported by GnuCash. The GnuCash format can store all
the properties supported by the basic JMoney plug-ins. However, other
JMoney plug-ins may add properties to the accounting objects. The JMoney
format will always be able to store these properties but the GnuCash
format may not be able to store them.</p>

<p>To save the data back to file, select <b>File &gt; Save</b> from
the menu. If you want to save to a different file or the data was not
loaded from a GnuCash file, select <b>File &gt; Save As</b>.</p>
