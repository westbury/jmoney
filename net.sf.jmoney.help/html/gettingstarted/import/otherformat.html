<h1>Extracting Data from an Unsupported File Format</h1>
<p>Even though JMoney has no support for the format of your current
accounting data, you have a few options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Someone may have written a plug-in to support the file format.
	Try posting a message on the jmoney-user@lists.sourceforge.net mailing
	list.</li>

	<li>If you are a developer you may write a plug-in to support your
	file format. First you must build JMoney from source (see the JMoney
	web site for instructions). You should implement an extension to the
	net.sf.jmoney.serialiseddatastore.filestores extension point. This
	extension point required the implementation of two methods: one to read
	the data from the file and one to write the data out to file.</li>

	<li>If the accounting software that you currently use supports
	export to Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) then you can export all your
	accounts and import them into JMoney by using the Import menu under the
	File menu.</li>
</ul>
